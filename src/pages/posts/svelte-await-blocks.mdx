title: How Svelte lets you call APIs directly in HTML

Svelte has lots of nice features to make a developer's life easier and their code more readable.
One of my favourites so far are the [Await blocks](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/await-blocks) that allow you to call APIs or do other asynchronous actions directly in the HTML markup.

For example, my previous code looked like this:

```svelte
<script>
  export let ingredients: Ingredient[] | null;

  onMount(async (): Promise<void> => {
  	ingredients = await getIngredients(); // This is an async API call to fetch some data.
  }

  // more code here...
</script>

<IngredientList {ingredients}/>

// more HTML here...
```

Here my code is declaring an empty list of `ingredients`, fetching the ingredient immediately after loading the component, and then passing the data to the `IngredientList` component so it can render it.
This works well, but it's a bit boilerplatey with the `onMount` function, and I haven't handled the way the app looks when the data is loading or if something goes wrong.
Svelte has a nicer way of doing this:

```svelte
// HTML here...

{#await getIngredients()}
	<p>Loading ingredients...</p>
{:then ingredients}
	<IngredientList {ingredients}/>
{:catch error}
	<p>{error}</p>
{/await}

// more HTML here...
```

Now we do all of the async fetching of the ingredients directly in the HTML of the component.
With `{#await getIngredients()}` we are fetching the raw data, after that we use the `:then` statement to send that data to the component (just like a normal Javascript Promise).
Finally we can add a `:catch` statement to handle any errors if they occur.

The really cool thing about this pattern is you can easily set the HTML and styling to set when the API call is loading, or when there is an error!
