Homebrew is essentially a package manager for programs running on Mac OS. Think of it as the app store but you download everything from your command line.

A Brewfile is a script that lists a project's 'dependencies' (or programs/tools it needs to run) to be downloaded from Homebrew.

To use it, simply add a `Brewfile` in the root directory of your project, include the brew packages you want to install, and run `brew bundle` in a terminal in that directory. It will then go through all the `brew` commands and run each one.

For example, say I have a `Brewfile` with the following contents:

```bash
#install git
brew "git"

#install nvm
brew "nvm"

# gets cask fonts repo and installs font-menlo-for-powerline font
tap "homebrew/cask-fonts"
cask "font-menlo-for-powerline"
```

When we run `brew bundle`:

- The lines with a `#` are comments and are skipped.
- The lines with `brew` are downloaded and installed. In this case we install Git and NVM.
- The line with `tap` makes a clone of the `homebrew/cask-fonts` repo, and allows you to get certain fonts with `cask <font>`

Once these bundles have installed, they are ready for use in your project.
