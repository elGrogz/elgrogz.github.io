import TweetOne from "@images/twitter-ifttt/tweet-1.png";
import TweetTwo from "@images/twitter-ifttt/twitter-image-2.png";

So it turns out I messed up the IFTTT step a bit in my [previous](https://grogz.blog/using-ifttt-to-post-on-twitter/) post.

The action took longer than expected to trigger and I was worried that it had failed on the RSS side, but fortunately RSS just takes a bit of time to update. When I checked Twitter, the tweet was there!

However, it wasn't quite right....

{/* {{< figure src="/post/images/twitter-ifttt/tweet-1.png" height="400px" >}} */}

<BlogImage src={TweetOne} alt="Twitter One" />

So I've done the following: changed the variable from the featured image one (maybe featured images don't work the way I thought with Hugo blogs) to hardcoded address where my logo is.

{/* {{< figure src="/post/images/twitter-ifttt/twitter-image-2.png" height="400px" >}} */}

<BlogImage src={TweetTwo} alt="Twitter Two" />

Hopefully it will work!
