I decided to move away from Hugo and try out Astro for this blog.
Hugo was a pain to deal with, especially for RSS, and it's pretty bloated.
So far Astro has been easy to setup, and the fact it is just react makes it easier to edit and add things to the site.
Liking it so far!

Hope you enjoy and see you in a year when I decide to post again!
